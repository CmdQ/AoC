# Advent of Code 2020

## Purpose

This repo is to keep track of my [AoC 2020][aoc] [progress] while learning [Julia][] ([docs]).

## Thoughts

### 01

- Could the variable number of nested loops be an opportunity for macros?
- The same could also be done with recursion. Does Julia do [TCO][]? No. :(
